**As an aspiring investor, I value humility and diligence as keys to growth. My approach focuses on what I can control daily, discipline in research and continuous education. Emphasizing risk management and emotional control in complex markets.**

**Technical analysis forms the core of my strategy, complemented by macroeconomic insights. I closely monitor monetary policy, interest rates, and money supply metrics, believing we're in the late stages of the current business cycle. Key indicators I track include CPI, labor market data, the U.S. Dollar Index, and FOMC statements.**

**I'm fascinated by market psychology and recurring patterns driven by investor behavior. This repetition isn't coincidence; it's a reflection of human nature playing out in markets. By studying these patterns and understanding cognitive biases, I aim to gain deeper insights into market movements and maintain emotional discipline.**

**I Â remain mindful that the investment landscape is ever-changing, and there is always more to learn. This drive for knowledge led me to independently study for and pass both the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) exam and the Series 66 exam. I also taught myself basic coding to build this website, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning.**
