### Short term outlook 
{:data-align="center"}

>This chart shows a possible trendline.

>This next image illustrates the possible trendlines, featuring a parallel channel on top. Dubious at best but the median line or midline does look interesting.

### Long term outlook 
{:data-align="center"}


#### 1976-1980

>A 757% gain over 1521 days

![A look at gold in 1976](:76.png)

### 1999-2011
>A 667% gain over a 4444 days 

![A pull back from a little over 1000$ down to 700$ in the 08-09 GFC](:99.png)

#### 2015-2038
>Of course, the farther ahead in time you try to look, the harder it is and the more speculative it gets. But here are two future possibilities if we had another bull gold cycle, assuming a longer timeframe (double the last cycle). Two different charts are shown here:
>### Scenario 1: 500% Gain
This chart illustrates where gold prices might reach with a 500% gain from current levels.

![a low end of what could be possible](:500.png)

>### Scenario 2: 550% Gain
This scenario depicts a more bullish 550% gain, which would put gold prices at approximately $8,000.
