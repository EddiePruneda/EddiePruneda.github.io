```python
While historical patterns can be informative, it's crucial to remember that market conditions and dynamics can change.

The question "Is this time different?" is indeed pertinent, as past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

Various factors, including regulatory changes, technological advancements, and global economic conditions, could influence these assets differently in 2024 compared to 2019.

Investors should consider these patterns as part of a broader analysis and not rely solely on historical comparisons when making investment decisions.
