# From Diversified to Concentrated: How Passive Investing is Creating a Stock Market Bubble
{:data-align="center"}

***

# The Rise of Passive Investing

Passive investing has gained tremendous popularity over the past decade, [with total assets in U.S. passive mutual funds and ETFs surpassing those in active ones for the first time in 2024]([https://jekyllrb.com/](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/27/the-stock-markets-concentration-in-one-chart)). This shift is particularly evident in 401(k) plans, where many investors opt for low-cost index funds that track market benchmarks.

Factors contributing to the preference for passive funds include:

<kbd>1. Performance:</kbd> [Only 29% of actively managed funds have outperformed their indexed peers over the past decade](https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/articles/article_stockmarketconcentration.pdf).
<kbd>2. Lower Costs:</kbd> [Some passive funds charge less than $10 per year for every $10,000 invested](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/market-concentration).
<kbd>3. Simplicity:</kbd> Passive investing requires minimal effort from investors.

# The Magnificent Seven Phenomenon

The "Magnificent Seven" stocks - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - have become a dominant force in the U.S. equity market. As of 2023, these [seven companies accounted for over 25% of the S&P 500's](https://www.investopedia.com/magnificent-seven-stocks-8402262) total market capitalization.

## Evidence of a Concentration Bubble

<kbd>1. Market Cap Concentration:</kbd> The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 now account for more than [30% of the index's total weight](https://journal.epistemikpress.id/index.php/IJSSR/article/download/51/46).
<kbd>2. Passive Fund Holdings:</kbd> Due to their market-cap weighting, these stocks make up a significant portion of [passive fund holdings](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/market-concentration).
<kbd>3. Performance Disparity:</kbd> The outperformance of large-cap stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven, has led to a situation where holding top contributors has become more important than avoiding the [biggest detractors](https://journal.epistemikpress.id/index.php/IJSSR/article/download/51/46).

# Risks and Implications

This concentration creates potential risks for investors, particularly those in passive funds. A decline in any of the top companies could disproportionately affect the portfolios of millions of passive investors[1]. It may be time for investors to reassess their portfolios and consider whether they are truly diversified or simply exposed to the next potential bubble.
