### Long term outlook 
{:data-align="center"}


#### 1976-1980

>A 757% gain over 1521 days

### 1999-2011
>A 667% gain over a 4444 days

#### 2015-2038
>Of course, the farther ahead in time you try to look, the harder it is and the more speculative it gets. But here are two future possibilities if we had another bull run gold cycle, assuming a longer timeframe (double the last cycle) ending in 2038. Two different charts are shown here:
>### Scenario 1: 500% Gain
This chart illustrates where gold prices might reach with a 500% gain from 2015 lows.

![a low end of what could be possible](:500.png)

>### Scenario 2: 550% Gain
This scenario depicts a more bullish 550% gain, which would put gold prices at approximately $6,800.

# Closing Thoughts on Gold: A Perspective on the Yellow Precious Metal

In the world of alternative investments, it's fascinating to observe the parallels between gold enthusiasts and Bitcoin advocates. Despite their apparent differences, these two groups share more common ground than they might realize. This reminds me of how different religions can clash despite sharing 95% of the same values. Similarly, gold bugs and bitcoiners often find themselves at odds, even though they fundamentally believe in many of the same principles:

- Decentralization
- Protection against inflation
- Skepticism of traditional financial systems

## Short-Term Gold Outlook

For those considering short-term positions in gold, I find value in adding to gold positions when prices touch the lower boundary of the parallel channel, as illustrated in the first chart. This strategy allows for potential entry points at technical support levels.

## Long-Term Considerations


Looking at the bigger picture, we're witnessing an intriguing phenomenon: gold is breaking new highs despite [record ETF outflows](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/etf-flows). This divergence suggests that while some investors are reducing their exposure through traditional financial products, other forces are driving the price upward. Notably, central [banks worldwide continue to accumulate gold](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/mi/research-analysis/despite-gold-hitting-record-highs-etf-flows-remain-muted.html), indicating a shift in global monetary perspectives.

The United States' financial situation further underscores the potential for gold appreciation:

1. **National Debt**: With the U.S. national debt surpassing $33 trillion, concerns about fiscal stability are mounting.
2. **Government Spending**: Uncontrolled government expenditures continue to expand the deficit.
3. **Entitlement Programs**: Social Security and Medicare costs are escalating at an unprecedented rate.
4. **Military Spending**: Defense budgets remain substantial, adding to overall fiscal pressures.

These factors collectively point towards the likelihood of future monetary expansion. As governments grapple with mounting debts and obligations, the printing of money often becomes an attractive, albeit problematic, solution. This scenario traditionally bodes well for gold, which has historically served as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflationary pressures.

It's worth noting that while ETF outflows have been significant, there are signs of this trend [narrowing](https://asia.nikkei.com/cms/Business/Markets/Commodities/Gold-ETF-inflows-reach-2-year-high-driven-by-expected-U.S.-rate-cut) recently. This could indicate a shift in investor sentiment or a response to changing market conditions.

The gold market has also seen increased [speculative activity and volatility](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/022/0017/004/article-A011-en.xml), with new market participants entering and potentially influencing price movements. This includes large purchases from the Middle East and small investors in the US, adding another layer of complexity to the market dynamics.

## Conclusion

While short-term trading strategies can capitalize on technical patterns, the long-term case for gold remains compelling. The combination of global central bank buying, record-high prices despite ETF outflows, and the looming specter of increased money printing creates a potentially favorable environment for gold in the years to come. As central banks embark upon a period of interest rate divergence, investors can expect to see growing volatility in currency markets, potentially increasing gold's attractiveness as a hedge.
