![A look at gold in 1976](:76.png)

### 1999-2011
>A 667% gain over a 4444 days 
![A pull back from a little over 1000$ down to 700$ in the 08-09 GFC](:99.png)

#### 2015-2038
>of course the farther ahead of time you try and look out the harder it is and the more speculative it gets. But here are two future possibilitys if we had another bull gold cycle assuming a longer time from (double last cycle) two diffrent charts here showing, first one showing a 500% gain and where that would put gold and a 550% gain as a higher target at which also puts it at around the even number of 8000$.
