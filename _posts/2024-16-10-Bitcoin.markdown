# Bitcoin: A Complex World

Bitcoin itself is a super complex protocol, and anytime you try to simplify something so intricate, you risk missing the mark. If I were to fully dive into Bitcoin, this whole website would turn into a Bitcoin page!

I've spent over 4 years learning about Bitcoin and its role in markets. While I can't cover everything here, I'd love to talk to anyone about Bitcoin or answer any questions they might have. As a humble investor, I realize I might not know all the answers, but I'm always eager to learn more.

## Key Areas of Interest

Some key things I find interesting and keep a close eye on are:

- Bitcoin dominance
- Bitcoin/Satoshi valuation of portfolios
- Bitcoin risk level metrics
- Various moving day averages
- Bitcoin's performance during different economic conditions:
  - Rising/falling interest rates
  - Quantitative easing/tightening

I could keep going, as I find it all fascinating. But what I've mentioned here is just the tip of the iceberg. The world of Bitcoin is vast and deep, with layers of complexity that continue to unfold the more you explore.

## Let's Connect

Rather than trying to cram everything into this website, I'd prefer to have a conversation in person. That way, we can start where your interests lie and explore from there.

**If you're curious about Bitcoin or have any questions, let's chat!**
